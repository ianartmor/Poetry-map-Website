There are many ways to get involved in the Poetry Post Project! 

1.  **Share here what you love about poetry posts**

2.  **Submit here any poetry posts you come across**

3.  **Spread the word so more people are helping identify posts (share the post submission link with friends, share on social media, other?)**

4.  **Serve as a neighborhood lead (learn more here)**

5.  **Donate here to support the project**

Contact us to let us know if you are interested in getting involved; we’ll follow up to chat about these and/or other opportunities and ideas you might have!
